<p><strong>What did it mean to be a man or a woman in the medieval world? What ideas did ordinary people have about gender, sex, and sexuality? This collection brings together a diverse array of texts from different genres.</strong></p><p><em>Concerning Man and Woman</em> is a highly succinct representation of the dominant ideology of sex in medieval Europe: one which blamed women for men’s failings based on the Biblical story of Genesis. A more substantial example of European misogyny is <em>The Wicked Woman</em>. A contrasting view of women’s virtue is offered by the martyrdom narrative <em>The Passion of the Holy Virgins</em>.</p><p>As for relations between the sexes, comic tales such as <em>The Gosling</em> and <em>The Girl Who Wanted to Fly</em> take a cynical, if light-hearted, view, contending that everyone is driven by sexual desire, even those who have taken vows of chastity. A more sombre&nbsp;take on this is provided by<em>The Charcoal-Burner of Nevers</em>, in which a pair of adulterous lovers are forced to become each other’s tormentors in order to be freed of their sin.</p><p>Departing from Europe, the three anecdotes from the <em>Record of the Listener</em> provide fascinating snapshots into the culture of Southern Song Dynasty China. Yan Shu’s <em>ci</em> “To the Tune ‘Willows by the Mountain Pavilion’”, attempts to convey something of the life experience of a Song Dynasty courtesan.</p>
