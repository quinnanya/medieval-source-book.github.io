 London, British Library, MS Add. 10289 f.129r [Public Domain]
 

## Introduction to the Source 
<p>The <span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="color:#333333">“</span></span>Roman des Franceis<span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="color:#333333">”</span></span> appears in <a href="http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Add_MS_10289">London, British Library, MS Add. 10289</a>, fols. 129v-132v. The manuscript was likely made in Mont-Saint-Michel in the late 13th century (Paris and Bos 1885, xix–xxiv; see also the BL manuscript notice), and besides the Roman des Franceis, it contains a number of other texts, listed by Paris and Bos. Some texts have a connection to the manuscript’s place of production, such as ours and Guillaume de Saint-Pair’s Roman du Mont-Saint-Michel, while others are less place-specific. The text of the <span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="color:#333333">“</span></span>Roman des Franceis<span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="color:#333333">”</span></span> is at times rather obscure, in all likelihood due to the vagaries of transmission. It has been edited by Achille Jubinal (1842, vol 2, 1–17), and more recently and with substantial improvements by Anthony Holden (1973). The <em>GMS</em> translation is based on an interpretive transcription of the Roman des Franceis, and occasionally draws on Holden’s edition, commentary or glossary to establish a legible text, where necessary.</p>
## Introduction to the Text 
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-041f347f-7fff-46a0-8b5a-4b04fbad12bc">The <span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="color:#333333">“</span></span>Roman des Franceis,<span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="color:#333333">”</span></span> also known as <span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="color:#333333">“</span></span>Arflet,<span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="color:#333333">”</span></span> is a short satirical piece in octosyllabic verses, arranged in four-line strophes. Its author, who names himself André (361, 371, 385, 395), has been confirmed by Gaston Paris to be André de Coutances, the Norman who is known as the author of an Évangile de Nicodème (Paris and Bos 1885, xvi–xix, xxiv–xxvii). It should be noted, however, that the attribution is hypothetical. Given its subject matter and the views expressed therein, it has been suggested that the Roman des Franceis could not have been written after 1204, when Philippe-Auguste invaded Normandy. </p> <p>The <span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="color:#333333">“</span></span>Roman des Franceis<span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="color:#333333">”</span></span> is presented as a charter issued by Alfred, king of Northumberland. It takes a biting stance towards the French, who are depicted as cowardly, stingy, and poor garlic-eating wretches. First, it stages the invasion of France by King Arthur (41-224), during which Arthur defeats Frollo, king of the French, in a duel (173-192) and throws the French into serfdom after the latter’s defeat (193-208). André then goes on to describe the stinginess of the French: to avoid petty fighting over food, they developed the tradition of tying pieces of bread to strings, allowing them to retrieve their share of soup (237-312; this motif has been studied by Félix Lecoy [1970]), and they have their guests pay for their share of food (345-360). The <span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="color:#333333">“</span></span>Roman des Franceis<span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="color:#333333">”</span></span> also includes a series of burlesque commandments proffered by Frollo (137-156). While the text chiefly targets the French, the English get their share of satirical observations too, heavy drinkers as they are (5-15). It should be noted that when the text refers to <span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="color:#333333">“</span></span>the French,<span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif"><span style="color:#333333">”</span></span> it might be refering to the inhabitants of the small royal domain surrounding Paris (see 62-64). At the time it was likely written, half of what we know as France was under Plantagenet rule, while the other half was only nominally subject to the king of France. The list of names at the end of the poem (386-396), as well as the list of peers of France, copied in Latin after the Roman and transcribed here, attests to this.</p>
