 De Heinrico The Song of Heinrich Nunc almus assis filius thero euuigero thiernun Now help, kind son of the eternal Virgin, benignus fautor mihi, thaz ig iz cosan muozi my benevolent protector, so that I may tell de quodam duce, themo heron Heinriche, of a certain duke, of Lord Heinrich, qui cum dignitate thero Beiaro riche beuuarode. who governed the realm of Bavaria with honor. Intrans nempe nuntius, then keisar namoda her thus: Once there came a herald, who addressed the emperor thus: ›cur sedes‹ infit ›Otdo. ther unsar keisar guodo “Why are you, our good emperor Otto, still sitting?” he asked. hic adest Heinrich bringit her hera kuniglich. “Heinrich is here, he brings a kingly entourage dignum tibi fore thir seluemo ze sine.‹ that would be worthy of being your own.” Tunc surrexit Otdo, ther unsar keisar guodo, Then Otto stood up, our good emperor, perrexit illi obuiam inde uilo manig man. and went towards him [Heinrich] together with many men et excepit illum mid mihilon eron. And he greeted him [Heinrich] with great honor Primitus quoque dixit: ›uuillicumo Heinrich, First he said:  “Welcome, Heinrich, ambo uos equiuoci, bethiu goda endi mi: to both of you with the same name, from both God and me. nec non et socii, uuillicumo sid gi mi.‹ And to your companions, too: you are welcome here.”Literally: 'you are welcome to me'. Dato responso fane Heinriche so scono After the greeting was returned in kind by Heinrich, coniunxere manus. her leida ina in thaz godes hus: they took each other by the hand. He [Otto] lead him to the church: petierunt ambo thero godes genatheno. both sought the grace of God. Oramine facto intfieng ina auer Otdo, After the prayer Otto took him again [by the hand?] duxit in concilium mit michelon eron And lead him with great honor to the council et admisit illi so uuaz so her þar hafode, And granted him everything that he had at his disposal, preter quod regale, thes thir Heinrih ni gerade. except royal prerogative, which Heinrich never coveted. Tunc stetit al thiu sprakha sub firmo Heinriche: So thereafter all counseling was under Heinrich’s stewardship. quicquid Otdo fecit, al geried iz Heinrih: Whatever Otto did, Heinrich advised him so. quicquid ac omisit, ouch geried iz Heinrihc. And whatever Otto did not do, Heinrich advised him so, too. Hic non fuit ullus – thes hafon ig guoda fulleist There was nobody – this has been confirmed nobilibus ac liberis, thaz thid allaz uuar is – to me to be true by both noblemen and freemen – cui non fecisset Heinrich allero rehto gilich. to whom Heinrich would not have served complete justice. 
 
## Introduction to the Source 
<p>The poem survives in only one source, commonly referred to as the Cambridge Songs Manuscript (<em>Carmina Cantabrigiensia</em>), which contains many examples of Goliardic Medieval poetry that is mostly in Latin but includes some French and German vernacular poems as well. The Goliards were young clergymen and university students who became poets and writers and were often critical of the church. Scholars have speculated that the Cambridge Songs Manuscript may have been a songbook for wandering minstrels, though it is more likely to have belonged to a court. The original was probably compiled in France before the Norman Conquest in 1066 CE and was copied before being lost or destroyed, with the surviving copy making its way to the church of St. Augustine at Canterbury and eventually to Cambridge University. A number of the songs and poems in the manuscript were set to music by Carl Orff (1895-1982) in his famous cantata <em>Carmina Burana</em>.</p>
## Introduction to the Text 
<p><em>De Heinrico</em> (literally <span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif">“</span>of Heinrich,<span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif">” </span>and here translated as <span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif">“</span>The Song of Heinrich<span style="font-family:"Times New Roman",serif">”</span>) is a tenth-century historical narrative poem which gives an account of an Emperor called Otto greeting a Duke called Heinrich and handing over most of his power to him, though retaining his title. There has been considerable scholarly debate over who exactly Otto and Heinrich are, given that there are so many noblemen of those names in this period in Germany. The most popular explanations are that the poem is about either (1) Otto I the Great and his brother Heinrich, who were reconciled in 941 CE, or (2) Otto III, who was a small child when Heinrich the Quarrelsome was reconciled with the court and became regent in 991 CE.</p> <p>A further puzzle presents itself in line 14, where Otto greets Heinrich saying “Welcome Heinrich, both of you with the same name.” There is little scholarly consensus as to who the second Heinrich with the same name could be, with some scholars even suggesting this accepted translation is completely wrong. Both Otto and Heinrich are portrayed as humble Christians who do not covet power. </p> <p>The poem consists of eight stanzas, each with either three or four lines. The first half of each line is in Latin and the second half is in Old High German.</p>
