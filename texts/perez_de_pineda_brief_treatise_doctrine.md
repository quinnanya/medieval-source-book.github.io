## Introduction to the Source 
<p>The first edition of <em>A Brief Treatise of Doctrine</em> was published in 1560 in Geneva by Jean Crespin, a printer with known Calvinist leanings. Along with the other works of Perez, this text was banned in Spain and would only have circulated through clandestine networks of Reformation sympathizers. By 1560, those networks were collapsing as more arrests were made in Spain by the Inquisition. Consequently, it is improbable that this text had a wide circulation. It likely would have disappeared were it not for the dedicated efforts of Luis de Usoz y Rio and his partner Benjamin B. Wiffen to collect and preserve reformist texts in the 19th Century. The two men worked cross-continentally to find rare books in small bookstores around the world. They re-bound and re-printed the works they found in the <em>Reformistas Antiguos Españoles (Old Spanish Reformers)</em>, the oldest editions of which are held today in the National Library of Spain.</p>
## Introduction to the Text 
<p>This Prologue to <em>A Brief Treatise of Doctrine</em> (1560) is attributed to Dr. Juan Perez de Piñeda—a Spanish scholar, theologian, priest, and condemned heretic. Perez published in Spanish while in exile in Francophone nations, collaborated with Jean Calvin, read Lutheran texts, and was in communication with other Spanish Reformers through clandestine networks. <em>A Brief Treatise of Doctrine</em> is representative of these intercultural and interdenominational influences in Perez’s own thought, and consequently resists established dichotomies between Spain and Europe, Catholicism and Protestantism, Calvinism and Lutheranism.</p> <p>Scholarship on Perez’s life and works is archetypical of scholarship on the Spanish Reformers in general. Catholic critic Marcelino Menedez y Pelayo aptly described the state of the field with the biblical appropriation: “the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few” (<a href="https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015041826192?urlappend=%3Bseq=9">“Historia de Los Heterodoxos Españoles, v.1.” 18</a>). Extensive bibliographic work on the Spanish Reformation has preserved and organized a plethora of primary sources pertenint to the field. Consequently, the few modern scholars who have worked on the Spanish Reformation have approached it in broad terms, producing long histories and general studies. While a handful of anglophone scholars have begun studying the reformers individually, much work remains. As such, <em>A Brief Treatise of Doctrine</em> is the perfect text to introduce into Anglophone consideration of the Spanish Reformation. With increased access to Perez’s writings, interdisciplinary studies on Perez can shed new light on the intricate web of theological developments sprawling onto the international stage of 16th-century Europe.</p>
