 Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional de España MS, VITR/17/7, f.138r [Public domain]
 
## Introduction to the Source 
<p>The poem is copied in Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional de España, VITR/17/7, fol. 138r-139r. This manuscript is a copy of the poetry collection known as the Cancionero de Estúñiga, ca. 1465. It has been digitized: <a href="http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?id=0000051837">http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?id=0000051837</a>. It contains a compilation of mostly Castilian poems, including ballads, as well as a few Italian compositions. Their authors attended the King of Aragon, Alfonso the Magnanimous, in Naples in the mid-fifteenth century.</p>
## Introduction to the Text 
<p>This poem is a <em>serranilla</em>, an evolution of the Provençal <em>pastorela</em>. Written in short verse (<em>arte menor</em>), <em>serranillas</em> narrate a courtly poet’s encounter with a mountain woman. This is one of six compositions in the genre by fifteenth-century author Carvajal (or Carvajales). Very little is known about Carvajal’s life. His poetry is linked to the Neapolitan court of Alfonso the Magnanimous in Naples (r. 1442-1458) and to that of Alfonso’s son Ferrante (r. 1459-1494). In addition to his famous <em>serranillas</em>, Carvajal is also known for his literary epistles and ballads.</p> <p dir="ltr">In this poem, the poet meets a fierce-looking wild woman who surprisingly offers courtly advice to the love-afflicted poet. It has been interpreted as a burlesque gloss of Juan Ruiz’s <em>Libro de buen amor</em>, one that conflates the serranas episodes with the discourse on <em>dueñas chicas</em> (‘little women,’ stanzas 1606-1617). The <em>Libro de buen amor</em> (1330/1343) is one of the masterpieces of medieval Castilian literature, a heterogenous, polysemous and oftentimes parodic text in which the narrator gives an account of his love life.</p>
