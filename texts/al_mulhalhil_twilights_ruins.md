     هل عرفْتَ الغداةَ مِن أطلالرَهْنِ ريحٍ ودِيمَةٍ مِهْطالِ Can you make out twilight’s ruins,Subject to windstorm and downpour? يسْتبينُ الحليمُ فيها رُسُوماًدارساتٍ كصنْعَةِ العُمَّالِ A sensible person discerns effacedTraces—the craft of artisans; قد رآها وأهلُها أهلُ صِدْقٍلا يريدون نيَّةَ الارتحالِ He beheld them. Their people—a constant people—Desired no departure.We may read these enigmatic opening lines as a threat to al-Ḥārith’s Bakr tribe. Presumably, al-Muhalhil will reduce the rival clan to the wasteland he has just described. Any sensible person who beholds these ruins must conclude that the land’s inhabitants were violently uprooted. يا لَقَومي لِلَوْعَةِ البَلْبالِولِقَتْلِ الكُماةِ والأبطالِ O my kinfolk, o grief for their agony,The killing of heroes and champions. ولِعيْنٍ تبادر الدَّمعُ منهالِكُلَيْبٍ إذ فاقها بانهمالِ O grief for eyes from which tears rushedLiterally, “And for an eye from which the tear rushed.”For Kulayb, overwhelmed with a downpour. لكليبٍ إذِ الرِّياحُ عليهناسفاتُ التُّرابِ بالأذْيالِ For Kulayb, windswept,The dust-scatterers about him. إنَّني زائرٌ جُمُوعاً لبكْرٍبينهم حارثٌ يُريدُ نِضالي I’ll visit Bakr’s troops,Among them Ḥārith: he desires my strife. قد شَفَيْتُ الغَلِيلَ من آلِ بكْرٍآلِ شَيْبانَ بين عَمٍّ وخالِ I brought out rancor from Bakr’s family,The clan of Shaybān,Shaybān: a sub-clan of the Bakr tribe.uncles between us.Literally: “The family of Shaybān between paternal and maternal uncles,” a possible allusion to the shared blood of the Bakr and Taghlib tribes, derived from the siblings Bakr and Taghlib. كَيْفَ صَبْري وقد قتلْتُم كليباًوشقِيتُم بِقتْله في الخوالي How be patient, and you killed Kulayb?You then suffered for his killing. فلَعَمْري لَأقْتُلَنَّ بكليبٍكلَّ قَيْلٍ يُسَمَّى من الأقيالِ By my life, I’ll kill for KulaybEvery chief named among the chiefs. ولعمري لقد وطِئْتُ بني بكرٍم بما قد جنَوْهُ وَطْءَ النِّعالِ By my life, I stomped Bakr’s offspringFor the crime they committed—the stomp of shoelaces.al-Muhalhil reportedly killed Bujayr, al-Ḥārith’s son, in compensation for the mere shoelace of his brother, Kulayb. See Introduction. لم أدَعْ غيْرَ أَكْلُبٍ ونِساءٍوإماءٍ حواطِبٍ وعيالِ I went without dogs, women,Bondswomen, maidservants, dependents.That is, al-Muhalhil vowed to renounce these and other pleasures until he took vengeance for his brother’s murder. فاشربوا ما وردتُّمُ الآنَ منَّاواصْدِروا خاسرين عن شرِّ حالِ Now drink what you’ve come toLiterally, “Drink what [body of water] you’ve arrived at now from us.”And flee badly defeated. زعمَ القوْمُ أنَّنا جارُ سُوءٍكذبَ القومُ عندنا في المقالِ The nationPresumably the Bakr tribe. claimed we are a harmful neighbor;They maligned us in the claim. لَمْ يَرَ النَّاسُ مِثْلَنَا يَوْمَ سِرْنَانَسْلُبُ المُلْكَ بِالرِّمَاحِ الطِّوَالِ The people hadn’t seen our likes the day we moved,Seizing the reign with long spears; يَوْمَ سِرْنَا إِلَى قَبَائِلِ عَوْفٍبِجُمُوعٍ زُهَاؤُوهَا كَالجِبَالِ The day we moved into ʿAuf’s tribesWith hordes high as mountains. بَيْنَهُمْ مَالِكٌ وَعَمْرٌو وَعَوْفٌوعُقَيْلٌ وصَالحُ بنُ هِلالِ Among them Mālik, and ʿAmr, and ʿAuf;ʿUqayl, and Ṣāliḥ ibn Hilāl. لمْ يَقُمْ سِيْفُ حارِثٍ بِقِتالٍأسْلَمَ الوالِداتِ في الأثقالِ Ḥārith’s sword rose not to fight,It surrendered mothers among the dead.Ḥārith’s sword may here serve as a synecdoche for the Bakr tribe’s army, which failed to protect its women. صَدَقَ الجَارُ إنَّنا قدْ قَتَلْنابِقِبَالِ النِّعالِ رَهْطَ الرِّجالِ The neighbor averred: we surely slewFor the sandal’s strap sundry kinsmen.That is, many men were slain for Kulayb’s shoelace. لا تَمَلَّ القِتالَ يا ابْنَ عُبادٍصَبِّرِ النَّفْسَ إنَّني غَيْرُ سالِ Ibn ʿUbād!That is, al-Ḥārith. the killing will not weary.Take patience: I’ve neither forgotten nor calmed. يا خَليلَيَّ قَرِّبا اليومَ مِنِّيكُلَّ وَرْدٍ وأدْهَمٍ صَهَّالِ Friends!In keeping with dramatic convention, Muhalhil calls out to two imagined companions, as did his rival, al-Ḥārith.Draw near me this dayEvery neigher, red and black.That is, horses, according to the color of their coats. قَرِّبا مَرْبَطَ المُشَهَّرِ مِنِّيلِكُلَيْبَ الَّذي أشابَ قذالي Draw Mushahhar’s harness near—Muhalhil’s ride, Naʿāmah’s match.For Kulayb, who grayed my head. قَرِّبا مَرْبَطَ المُشَهَّرِ مِنِّيواسألاني ولا تطِيلا سُؤالي Draw Mushahhar’s harness near—Ask me, but don’t prolong my inquiry. قَرِّبا مَرْبَطَ المُشَهَّرِ مِنِّيسَوف تبدو لنا ذواتُ الحِجالِ Draw Mushahhar’s harness near—Brides will be revealed to us.Bakr’s women, literally, “the ones of the curtained canopies,” “dhawāt al-ḥijāl,” prospective prisoners of war. قَرِّبا مَرْبَطَ المُشَهَّرِ مِنِّيإنَّ قولي مُطابِقٌ لِفِعالي Draw Mushahhar’s harness near—My speech matches my deeds indeed. قَرِّبا مَرْبَطَ المُشَهَّرِ مِنِّيلِكُلَيْبٍ فداهُ عَمِّي وخالي Draw Mushahhar’s harness near—For Kulayb—may my uncles be ransomed!To wish that a person (or persons) be ransomed for another conveys the seriousness of a subject or situation while communicating the latter’s dearness to the oathmaker. قَرِّبا مَرْبَطَ المُشَهَّرِ مِنِّيلاعتناق الكُماةِ والأبطالِ Draw Mushahhar’s harness near—For the embrace of soldiers and heroes. قَرِّبا مَرْبَطَ المُشَهَّرِ مِنِّيسَوف أصْلي نِيرانَ آلِ بِلالِ Draw Mushahhar’s harness near—I’ll feed the flames of Bilāl’s family. قَرِّبا مَرْبَطَ المُشَهَّرِ مِنِّيإن تلاقت رِجالُهُم ورِجالي Draw Mushahhar’s harness near—Should their men meet mine. قَرِّبا مَرْبَطَ المُشَهَّرِ مِنِّيطالَ لَيلي وأقْصَرَتْ عُذَّالي Draw Mushahhar’s harness near—My night stretched.Probably from riding or raiding. My critics shrank. قَرِّبا مَرْبَطَ المُشَهَّرِ مِنِّييا لبكرٍ وأين منكم وِصالي Draw Mushahhar’s harness near—Bakr! where’s our rendezvous? قَرِّبا مَرْبَطَ المُشَهَّرِ مِنِّيلِنضالٍ إذا أرادوا نِضالي Draw Mushahhar’s harness near—For fighting, should they want my fight. قَرِّبا مَرْبَطَ المُشَهَّرِ مِنِّيلقتيلٍ سَفَتْهُ ريحُ الشَّمالِ Draw Mushahhar’s harness near—For a slain man scattered by the north wind.Presumably, Kulayb’s corpse was left exposed to the elements. قَرِّبا مَرْبَطَ المُشَهَّرِ مِنِّيمع رُمْحٍ مُثَقَّفٍ عَسَّالِ Draw Mushahhar’s harness near—With a straight, supple spear. قَرِّبا مَرْبَطَ المُشَهَّرِ مِنِّيقَرِّباهُ وقَرِّبا سِرْبالي Draw Mushahhar’s harness near—Bring it, and bring my armor, ثُمَّ قولا لِكُلِّ كَهْلٍ وناشٍمن بني بَكْرَ جَرِّدُوا للقِتال Then tell every ready adult maleFrom Bakr’s offspring: unsheathe for bloodshed. قد مَلَكْناكمُ فكُونوا عَبيدًاما لكم عن مِلاكِنا مِن مَجالِ We owned you, so become slaves!You have no leeway from our reign. وخُذُوا حِذْرَكُم وشُدُّوا وجِدُّواواصْبِرُوا للنِّزالِ بعد النِّزالِ Take heed, resolve, and vie;Brace for battle after battle. فلقد أصبحت جمائعُ بكرٍمِثلَ عادٍ إذ مُزِّقَتْ في الرِّمالِ Thus Bakr’s forces becameAs ʿĀd, torn up in the sands.ʿĀd: the notorious tribe obliterated by windstorm. يا كُليبًا أَجِبْ لِدَعْوَةِ داعٍمُوجَعِ القَلبِ دائمِ البَلْبَالِ Kulayb: answer a suppliant’s plea,Heartsore, ever-anxious. فلقد كنتَ غيرَ نِكْسٍ لَدَى البَأْسِ ولا واهنٍ ولا مِكْسالِ You were not one to shun the mighty,Neither weak nor lazy. قد ذبحنا الأطفالَ من آلِ بكرٍوقهرنا كُماتَهُم بالنِّضالِ We butchered Bakr’s family’s children,Thrashed their militia viciously, وكَرَرْنا عليهم وانثنيْنابِسُيوفٍ تقُدُّ في الأوْصالِ Charged them repeatedly, leaned inWith swords slitting joints. أسْلَموا كلَّ ذاتِ بَعْلٍ وأُخْرىذاتَ خِدرٍ غرَّاءَ مِثْلَ الهلالِ They submitted, every wife and othersEnclosed, white as the crescent.Collectively, Bakr’s women, screened by a green veil.

## Introduction to the Text 
<p>The seventh-century advent of Islam precipitated a breakthrough in historiography. In the centuries that followed the religion’s arrival, linguists, lexicographers, and chroniclers spared no effort to write all they knew of the Arabs’ pre-Islamic days, much of it preserved in verse. This poetry commemorated landmarks of the past—events not so much faithfully recorded as artistically imagined to drive home their import.</p> <p>One such event, the legendary Basūs war between the sibling tribes of Taghlib and Bakr (ca.494-534), comes to us by way of several poems. They relate the following story: a forty-year war broke out with the murder of the Taghlibs’ leader, Wāʾil ibn Rabīʿah, better known as Kulayb. Not long before, Kulayb’s aunt-in-law, al-Basūs bint Munqidh, hosted Saʿd ibn Shumays as a resident under her protection. Saʿd’s she-camel, al-Sarāb, was pastured with those of Jassās ibn Murrah, her nephew and Kulayb’s brother-in-law. Noticing the unfamiliar camel among his herd, Kulayb warned Jassās that al-Sarāb was not welcome to pasture near his land. Jassās responded that none of his camels would pasture without her. Kulayb then threatened that if he saw the camel again, he’d stick an arrow in her breast. If he did so, said Jassās, he’d stick an arrow in Kulayb's neck. Despite this grave threat, Kulayb fatally struck al-Sarāb when he encountered her again. al-Basūs shared her humiliation with her nephew, vowing to kill Kulayb’s most prized camel, Ghilāl, in retaliation. Jassās set his mind instead to killing Kulayb, which he did.</p> <p>Following Kulayb’s murder, Taghlib leadership transferred to Kulayb's brother, ʿAdiyy ibn Rab īʿah, styled “al-Muhalhil” (“The Refiner”) on account of the refinement of his poetry. al-Muhalhil maintained a killing streak for several decades, culminating in the deaths of both Jassās and his half-brother, Hammām. A third half-brother, al-Ḥārith ibn ʿUbād (or ʿAbbād), who had avoided the conflict entirely until this point, now intervened, dispatching a letter to al-Muhalhil. The message, sent with al-Ḥārith’s son, Bujayr, offered al-Muhalhil the choice of either slaying Bujayr and ending the bloodshed definitively, or releasing him to likewise establish peace. al-Muhalhil proclaimed “buʾ bi-shisʿ naʿl Kulayb!” (“Take payback for Kulayb’s shoelace!”) and slew Bujayr.</p> <p>al-Ḥārith initially accepted his son’s sacrifice for the sake of peace. When he heard al-Muhalhil’s taunt, however, al-Ḥārith was incensed and decided to enter the battle, conclusively defeating the Taghlibs and capturing their leader, al-Muhalhil. Failing to recognize who he had captured, al-Ḥārith commanded his prisoner to lead him to al-Muhalhil; the latter promised to do so on the condition that he would not harm him. al-Ḥārith acquiesced. When the prisoner identified himself as al-Muhalhil, al-Ḥārith was true to his word, cutting off al-Muhalhil’s forelock (a mark of humiliation in this society) but otherwise leaving him alone.</p> <p>Another text in the <em>Global Medieval Sourcebook</em>, “<a href="http://sourcebook.stanford.edu/text/everythings-destined-toward-demise">Everything's destined toward demise</a>”, voices al-Ḥārith's elegy for his slain son, Bujayr. “Can you make out twilight's ruins?” presents al-Muhalhil’s response to al-Ḥārith’s elegy. Here, the Taghlibs’ leader mourns his brother’s murder and responds to al-Ḥārith’s call for revenge with a refrain of his own: “Qarribā marbaṭ al-Mushahhar minnī,” (“Bring me al-Mushahhar’s harness”): just as al-Ḥārith had called on his war horse, al-Naʿāmah, so, too, does al-Muhalhil call on al-Mushahhar to enter the battle. al-Muhalhil’s poem stands out for its ferocious expressions of <em>jāhilī </em>(pre-Islamic values), including engagement in ceaseless, disproportionate feuding and the murder and plunder of innocents. These were values that the new religion explicitly rejected yet carefully transcribed in its poetic record of pre-Islamic history. While these two poems have traditionally been ascribed, respectively, to al-Harith and al-Muhalhil themselves, more research is required to determine their precise transmission and authorship.</p>
