 玉樓春·湖邊柳外樓高處 To the tune “Spring in the Jade Building” 湖邊柳外樓高處。  In a tall building behind the willows by the lakeside, 望斷雲山多少路 How many roads in the misty mountains have I stared to the end of? 闌干倚遍使人愁， I have leant against all the railings, feeling disheartened; 又是天涯初日暮。 Again, the sun starts to set at the edge of the sky. 輕無管系狂無數。 Light without being tied down, The Chinese characters 管系 literally mean "discipline" and "obstacle". wild and numerous, 水畔花飛風裏絮。 Petals fly beside the water, willow catkins are blown by the wind. 算伊渾似薄情郎， They are just like my fickle lover, 去便不來來便去。 Leaving without returning, coming and soon departing. 
 
## Introduction to the Text 
<p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-707dfd6b-7fff-1cec-6c05-327e617a53da">This song lyric is a woman's complaint about her lover. However, the two stanzas are quite different in tone and content. In the first, she sings wistfully of her longing; in the second, the focus shifts to her lover's inconstancy.</p> <p dir="ltr">The <em>ci</em> genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). <em>Ci</em> is usually translated into English as “song lyrics.” This is because <em>ci</em> were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of <em>ci</em> vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing <em>ci</em> would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertainment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying <em>ci</em> would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many <em>ci</em> poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of <em>ci</em>: <em>wǎnyuē</em> (婉约, “graceful”) and <em>háofàng</em> (豪放, “bold”). The <em>wǎnyuē</em> subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the<em> háofàng</em> subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service.</p> <p dir="ltr">Ouyang Xiu was a highly influential politician, scholar, and historian of the Northern Song dynasty. He was revered as a grand master of literature and philosophy, and it is not an exaggeration to say that he laid the foundation for the literati mentality of the dynasty. When Ouyang was four years old, the death of his father, a fifty-seven-year-old military officer, left the family destitute. Poverty did not stop Ouyang’s passion for reading: he would borrow books from his neighbors and make copies in order to study them further. Later, he became a bureaucrat and was posted to many cities as a prefect of the imperial court. In his political life, he was principled and solemn, and wrote a great deal in many genres. Much of his writing reflects his dignified character. His song lyrics, however, provide an interesting contrast. Their content may be drawn in part from the colorful private life he enjoyed in his younger years, including liaisons with many different courtesans. Interestingly, they are often written from the perspective of a lovelorn courtesan abandoned by an inconstant lover, in effect casting himself as the villain.</p>
