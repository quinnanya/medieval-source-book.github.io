 Initial P: A Man Speaking to Four Youths and A Man Placing a Ring on a Woman's Hand, Getty Museum Ms. Ludwig XIV 6 (83.MQ.165), fol. 205v, about 1290–1310 [Public Domain]
 
## Introduction to the Source 
<p>This poem is a <em>unicum</em> copied in Zaragoza, Biblioteca de la Universidad de Zaragoza, MS 210, fol. 98v-99r (the <em>Cançoner de Saragossa</em>). The manuscript has been digitized <a href="http://zaguan.unizar.es/record/535?ln=en">here</a>. It contains a compilation of Catalan verse dating to 1461-1462. It is the oldest known manuscript to transmit Ausiàs March’s poetry, and an important witness to the transmission of the poetry of several other authors, including Pere Torroella and Lleonard de Sors.</p>
## Introduction to the Text 
<p>This poem was composed ca. 1410-1424 by Valencian author Jordi de Sant Jordi, a son of a Muslim convert and valet of the chamber of the king of the Crown of Aragon, Alfonso the Magnanimous (1396-1458). It is believed to have been dedicated to the widowed Queen Margarida de Prades (1387-1429). The poem is written in Catalan with Occitan traits. It is in <em>versos estramps</em>, blank verses ending in unique, sonorous, words that are also known as <em>rims fènix</em>. Some of these rhyme words come from the famous <em>sestina</em> by Occitan troubadour Arnaut Daniel. <em>Versos estramps</em> in fact seem to be an evolution or an innovative version of the traditional <em>sestina</em>.</p> <p>This love poem features a sustained and multifaceted praise of the lady with attention to both her physical and moral beauty as well as a declaration of the steadfast love of the lyric voice. A dense, object-oriented imagery pervades each stanza. The text is considered the most remarkable love song of the <em>trobar ric</em> tradition in medieval Catalan poetry.</p>
