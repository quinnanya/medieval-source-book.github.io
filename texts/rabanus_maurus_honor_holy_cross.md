## Introduction to the Text 
<p>This text is one of a series of figure poems by Rabanus Maurus (c.780-856 CE), a Benedictine monk and prolific writer who rose to become archbishop of Mainz (in what is now western Germany). The speaker in the poem is a Christian kneeling before the cross, praying to the crucified Christ, and this is mirrored by the shape of the poem on the page of the manuscript: words surrounding - and forming - the shape of a cross.</p>
