 Sanā’ī al-Ghaznavī, Abū al-Majd Majdūd ibn Ādam. Huva kitāb-i mustaṭāb-i kullīyāt. Bombay: Khan Sahib M.M. Shirazi, 1328 [1910]. Library of Congress [Public Domain]]
 
## Introduction to the Source 
<p>The <em>Dīvān</em>, in which the aforementioned poem appears, was published in Bombay in 1910 by Khan Sahib M.M. Shirazi. The collection contains 14,000 distichs that mainly revolve around religious themes, such as eschewing the <em>nafs</em> [carnal soul], performing the <em>dhikr</em>, and abandoning the cupidity of worldly substance and goods, among others.</p>
## Introduction to the Text 
<p>Sanā’ī of Ghazna (d. 1131 C.E.) was the first major poet of classical Persian Sufi literature. He was a monumental poet not just because of his versification skills, but also because of his profound influence upon Sufi poets such as ‘Aṭṭār of Kadkan (d. 1225 C.E.) and Mawlavī (Rumi) (d. 1273 C.E.). “On the Merciful God and on the Birds’ Glorifications,” in the <em>Dīvān</em> [collection of poems], is a <em>qaṣīda</em> (laudatory poem) comprising three key themes: nature, the centrality of the Sufi concept of <em>dhikr</em> (remembrance) to man’s salvation, and <em>tawḥīd</em> (the Oneness of God).</p> <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-44961c08-7fff-e1e1-71be-31c410e0345f">At the very beginning of the poem, Sanā’ī depicts one of the blessings of God, which is in the form of bountiful rain. Spring is the ideal setting for the poet to portray the avian species’ glorifications, not only because the revivification of nature takes place, but more importantly, because spring’s abundant rain is a sign of God’s forgiveness toward mankind. <em>Dhikr</em>—a central practice in Islamic esoterism, derived from the Qur’an—and <em>tawḥīd</em> are two themes communicated through multifarious talking birds, such as the <em>humā</em>—a mythical bird like an eagle, who acknowledges the Oneness of God by saying, “The Unequaled is One.” Medieval Persian authors deployed the bird metaphor to concretize abstract Sufi concepts (e.g., <em>dhikr</em>). Further, the Qur’an—an important source of influence upon Muslim thinkers—likens birds to human communities (6/<em>Al-An‘ām</em>: 38). Sanā’ī conceives of birds as purposeful signs for humans to make sense of the universe. The red pigeon, for instance, serves as a spiritual model for humans, saying huwa [He] “one-hundred times with each breath.” </p> <p dir="ltr" id="docs-internal-guid-85e28b4a-7fff-f7f4-1a22-d47f7e177141">The poem contains abundant stylistic features. Sanā’ī’s use of periphrasis is seen in “The <em>Riḍwān</em> (an angel) opens all the gates of Paradise,” which is a circumlocutory way of emphasizing divine blessings in springtime. He employs sensory imagery: olfactory (“qālīyih” [a fragrant substance comprising musk, ambergris, and pussy willow], “mounds of camphor,” etc.), auditory (“wind’s blowing,” “cock’s crow,” “wailing,” etc.), tactile (“silk and ermine coat,” etc.), kinesthetic (“quivering trees,” “lark’s strut,” etc.), and thermal (“autumn”). This rich imagery provides the reader with a vivid picture of nature. The poet’s allusion to 55/<em>Al-Raḥmān</em>: 70 (“ ‘good and beautiful ones’ ”) illustrates that he was inspired by the Qur’an. Other stylistic features include alliteration (“character and customs” [<em>sīrat va sān</em>]) and consonance (“the Omnipotent Subduer” [<em>qādir-i qahhār</em>]). Finally, in classical Persian literature, it was common for poets to address themselves—especially at the end of poems—by using their pen names; the final distich that includes the poet’s pen name (i.e., <em>Majdūd</em>) in a <em>qaṣīda</em> is called <em>takhallus</em>. Sanā’ī’s use of <em>takhallus</em> might convince his audience to take his sermon seriously: whilst the poet pleads with his readers to shun the indulgences of the fleeting world, he acknowledges in the final distich that he needs to purify his own soul (“<em>Majdūd</em>! You are closer to this state, for / Old age has indeed summoned autumn”). </p>
