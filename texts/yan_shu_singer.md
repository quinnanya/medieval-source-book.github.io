 贈歌者 To a singer 家住西秦。 My family lived in the west of Qin, 賭博藝隨身。 I lived by my skills and talent in dancing and song; 花柳上、鬥尖新。 among all the blossoms and willows, 偶學念奴聲調， Occasionally I imitated the tunes of Niannu, 有時高遏行雲。 my voice could halt floating clouds in their path. 蜀錦纏頭無數， I have countless Shu brocades and silks, 不負辛勤。 my efforts were well-rewarded. 數年來往咸京道， For years now I have traveled between Xianyang and the capital. 殘杯冷炙謾消魂。 Leftover wine and cold food consume my spirit. 衷腸事、託何人。 To whom can I confide the things deep in my heart? 若有知音見採， If a patron who appreciated me would choose me, 不辭遍唱陽春。 I would willingly sing every one of the finest songs. 一曲當筵落淚， Now, a single song at the banquet and my tears start to fall. 重掩羅巾。 Once again, I hide my face with the silk kerchief. 
 
## Introduction to the Text 
<p>The subtitle of this <em>ci</em> suggests that it is supposed to be a gift for a particular singer, yet it also serves as a general depiction of a courtesan’s life during the Song Dynasty. One thing to be noted is the distinction between courtesans and singers. These two professions are often hard to discern in Song Dynasty ci. Even though they have similar names in Chinese, 妓 (ji) for courtesans and 歌姬 (ge ji) for singers, and their place of work is often similar, the singers’ work did not involve prostitution.</p> <p>The two stanzas of this song are an example of antithesis. The first stanza is about how successful the singer was when she was younger, when she competed with the other “blossoms and willows” (i.e., courtesans) for men’s attention, and the second is about her troublesome and lonely life now that she is older and considered less desirable. This piece uses the example of one singer’s unfortunate fate to reflect on the lives of thousands of other singers: they were loved by affluent society when they were young, and cast aside when they were no longer valuable. At the same time, the song may have a secondary meaning as a reflection upon the poet’s own misfortune of not achieving the rank he wanted at the imperial court.</p> <p>The <em>ci</em> genre of Chinese poetry first emerged in the Sui dynasty (581-619), was further developed in the Tang dynasty (618-907) and matured in the Northern Song dynasty (960-1127). <em>Ci</em> is usually translated into English as "song lyrics". This is because <em>ci</em> were composed by poets to fit pre-existing tunes. The number of lines, the line lengths, and the tonal and rhythmic patterns of <em>ci</em> vary with the tunes, which number in the hundreds. One common occasion for composing <em>ci</em> would be a banquet: song lyrics would be scribbled down by guests and then sung by musical performers as entertainment. Other occasions for composing and enjoying <em>ci</em> would be more casual: the poet might sing the lyrics to himself at home or while travelling (many <em>ci</em> poets were civil servants of the Imperial Court and often had to travel great distances to carry out their work). Sometimes the lyrics would be sung by ordinary people in the same way as folk songs. This oral and musical quality sets it apart from other genres of poetry in China during the same period, which were largely written texts with more elevated objectives. There are two main types of <em>ci</em>: <em>wǎnyuē</em> (婉约, "graceful") and <em>háofàng</em> (豪放, "bold"). The <em>wǎnyuē</em> subgenre primarily focuses on emotion and many of its lyrics are about courtship and love, while the<em> háofàng</em> subgenre often deals with themes that were considered more profound by contemporary audiences, such as ageing and mortality, or the rewards and disappointments of public service.</p> <p>Yan Shu, a powerful statesman in the early Northern Song court, had a long and successful career both as an official and as a poet. Among his many literary achievements (which include poetry, song lyrics and prose) his <em>ci</em> compositions are best known. His lyrics are elegant in their choice of words, controlled in the emotions they express, and not as playful as the ci of other well-known poets. They often capture feelings of solitude and sorrow, creating a melancholic mood, but the poet is rarely explicit about what triggers the worry or sadness.</p>
