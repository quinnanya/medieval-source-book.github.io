## Introduction to the Source 
<p>This spiritual biography was written between 1450 and 1479 by Hermann Greven (Hermannus Gresgenius), a Carthusian monk in Cologne. It is part of a martyrology, or catalogue of martyrs and saints, authored by Greven and based on a ninth-century text by the monk Usuard. The present translation is based on the Latin edition in the <a href="http://acta.chadwyck.co.uk/">Acta sanctorum</a>. More information on the text and the original manuscript is available <a href="https://www.geschichtsquellen.de/werk/3448">here</a>.</p>
## Introduction to the Text 
<p>This spiritual biography (or <em>vita</em>) concerns the life and sanctity of a woman named Haseka, a recluse in the church of Schermbeck, in today’s North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The author praises Haseka’s pious way of life and inclination against human company before describing a miracle in which Haseka (through God’s intervention) changes rancid butter into fresh, and then relating the conflict between monasteries over the right to bury Haseka’s dead body. Once finally buried, Haseka appears to a widow in her sleep. The <em>vita</em> ends by foretelling the popular veneration of this holy recluse.</p> <p>As a recluse, Haseka adopted a type of religious life which centred around her physical enclosure inside a small dwelling. This form of life existed throughout the European Middle Ages; terms for such enclosed, devotional people include anchorite, anchoress, and solitary. In the later Middle Ages it was common, as in Haseka’s case, for women recluses to live in a house or cell attached to a parish church. The recluse was expected to lead an exemplary holy life and pray for the souls of those who offered her donations and alms. Frequently, recluses could also exercise a kind of charismatic authority, offering advice or teachings to interested passersby.</p> <p>Since recluses were bound to their dwellings, they needed the support of outsiders to stay alive and to minister to their daily needs. It is interesting to note the prominent role played by Haseka’s attendant in this spiritual biography. The author calls her “Sister Berta”, and does not call her a servant as such but rather “ministra”. He also portrays her as very close to the recluse: Berta has influence over Haseka’s goods (when she tries to remove the rancid butter), and eats with her at the same table. Both Berta, the recluse’s attendant, and the nameless, pious widow, to whom the postmortem Haseka appears, suggest a rich landscape of non-cloistered religious women, existing alongside recluses and monasteries in this period.</p>
